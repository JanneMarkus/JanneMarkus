- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name is Janne (pronounced like "yuhn-neh"). Some call me by my middle name, Markus. I've been coding as a hobby since 2018.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and computer science for practical applications. Building apps or scripts that make my life easier really gets me going. Right now, I'm mainly involved in front-end dev, but hoping a future project will take me into some backend too.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build multi-platform applications with Flutter.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at janne@vertexvantage.com
